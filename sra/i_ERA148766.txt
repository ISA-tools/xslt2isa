STUDY
Comment[SRA broker]	
Study Identifier	ERP001652
Study Title	Updated raw reads from the YH (Homo sapiens) genome (version SOAPdenovo2). The genomic DNA used in this study came from an anonymous male Han Chinese individual who has no known genetic diseases.
Study Description	The SOAPdenovo2 version YH genome was assembled based on 2.1 billion reads using the Illumina HiSeq2000.  We achieved 202G nucleotides data and the genome was sequenced to 67.5-fold average coverage.  By aligning the short reads with SOAP, 177G nucleotides were mapped onto the NCBI reference genome and 99.99% of the genome was covered.
